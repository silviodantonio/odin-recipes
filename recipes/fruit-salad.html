    <p>A nice fresh dessert and snack to eat during spring and summer days</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fruit of your choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the fruit and put it in a bowl</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some sugar on top and mix</li>
        <li>Let it rest for some time, even half an our should be enough</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        If the fruit it's already sweet enough you could skip the sugar. You can even
        skip the resting phase and eat it right away!
